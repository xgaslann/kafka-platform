> Kafka-platform project is for understanding terraform -> ansible -> kafka -> monitoring stack.
> This project will help you to understand how to provision infrastructure using terraform, deploy applications using ansible, and monitor the applications using monitoring stack.
> Before running this project, make sure you have terraform and ansible installed on your machine.
> For that purpose I prepared a installation file for MacOS if you want to run this project on your local machine.
> You can find the installation file here: [Installation](./INSTALLATION.md)

> After installing the required tools, we can talk about the kafka-platform project.
> I will be using the AWS cloud provider for this project. But if you want to run this project on your local machine, you can use virtualbox.
> Let's talk about the project.
